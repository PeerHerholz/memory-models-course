# Final Project: Open-Ended Exploration of Memory Models

## Overview
For your final project, you will **design and conduct an original investigation** into a memory model of your choice. Your goal is to **do something substantive and interesting** with the model and dataset. This project is open-ended: you are encouraged to explore novel ideas, extensions, and applications.  You may work with **up to 2 other students** on this assignment.  If you choose to work in a group, all group members will receive the same grade for the assignment, regardless of individual member contributions, group dynamics, etc.

## Choosing Your Model and Dataset
You may select:
- **A model from a previous assignment** (e.g., Hopfield Networks, SAM, CMR, Laplace TCM).
- **A different model from the literature** (e.g., a model from a published paper of your choice).
- **A new model that you design yourself**.

Similarly, you may select:
- **A dataset from a previous assignment** (e.g., Murdock, 1962 free recall data).
- **A different experimental dataset** from sources such as the [Penn Memory Lab Data Archive](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Data_Archive).
- **A synthetic dataset** that you generate to test specific properties of a model.

## Project Scope and Expectations
Your project should explore the model and dataset in a **meaningful, non-trivial** way. Some possible directions include:

- **Examining the model’s strengths, limitations, or failure modes**  
  (e.g., testing whether a model’s predictions break down in edge cases).
- **Extending or modifying the model**  
  (e.g., adding new parameters, changing the retrieval dynamics, incorporating neural constraints).
- **Applying the model to a new type of dataset**  
  (e.g., fitting a free recall model to recognition memory data).
- **Comparing multiple models**  
  (e.g., testing whether SAM or CMR better predicts a given dataset).

## Deliverables
Your submission should include:

1. **Code Implementation**  
   - Submit a **Google Colaboratory notebook (or similar format)** with well-commented code.
   - Ensure that all figures are generated within the notebook.
   - The notebook should **run without errors**.

2. **Project Report (2–5 pages, PDF format)**
   - **Introduction:** Describe the **model**, **dataset**, and the research question you are addressing.
   - **Methods:** Explain how you implemented the model, the experiments you ran, and any modifications you made.
   - **Results:** Present key findings with clear figures and tables.
   - **Discussion:** Interpret the results. What insights did you gain? Were there unexpected outcomes? What could be improved?
   - **References:** Cite any papers, datasets, or external sources you used.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be graded based on the following criteria:

- **Creativity & Interestingness (30%)**  
  - Is the project novel, insightful, or thought-provoking?
  - Does it go beyond trivial or obvious analyses?

- **Correctness of Implementation (30%)**  
  - Is the model correctly implemented and well-documented?
  - Do the results make sense given the model and data?

- **Logic & Clarity (20%)**  
  - Is the report well-organized and easy to understand?
  - Are the arguments and conclusions well-reasoned?

- **Depth & Detail (20%)**  
  - Does the project explore the model in sufficient depth?
  - Are analyses thorough and well-supported by results?

## Submission Instructions
- Submit a **Google Colaboratory notebook (or equivalent) containing your implementation**.
- Submit a **PDF report (2–5 pages)** with figures and results.
- Ensure that all files are well-organized and clearly named.

Good luck, and enjoy the exploration!
